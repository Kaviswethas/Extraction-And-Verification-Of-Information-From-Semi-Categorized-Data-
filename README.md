# 1.Introduction to project
<a name="intro"></a>

In modern recruitment processes, the verification is conducted manually, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors. The proposed solution utilizes by automating the verification of biodata applications and supporting documents by Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) techniques, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to streamline the extraction and validation of information from various documents such as educational certificates and GATE scorecards, which may be in image or PDF formats and in languages other than Hindi or English. Candidates will upload their biodata and documents through a web portal, where a Translation API will assist with language discrepancies. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) will be employed to extract text from these documents, storing the information temporarily for validation. NLP techniques will then process this data to ensure accuracy. In cases of mismatches, alerts will notify users immediately. Upon successful verification, both the documents and validated user data will be securely stored in a database. This innovative approach aims for high accuracy in data extraction (Three Sigma accuracy) and significantly enhances the efficiency of candidate assessment, ultimately transforming the operational workflow.

# 2.What is OCR ?
<a name="ocr"></a>
OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It's a technology that enables the conversion of different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. Essentially, OCR software identifies text within images or scanned documents and converts it into machine-readable text.

Machine learning and AI play significant roles in OCR technology. Machine learning (ML) powers OCR to turn images into text. ML algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained on massive datasets to recognize characters. ML also helps extract key features from images and utilizes language models to understand context and improve accuracy, especially for ambiguous characters. OCR systems continuously learn and adapt to specific domains and languages through ML, ensuring ever-better performance.

Here are some common applications and domains where OCR is used:

- Document Digitization: OCR is extensively used to convert scanned documents, PDFs, and images into editable and searchable text. This is useful in offices, libraries, and archives for digitizing large volumes of documents for easier storage, retrieval, and sharing.
  
- Data Entry Automation: OCR automates data entry processes by extracting text from documents such as invoices, receipts, and forms. This saves time and reduces errors associated with manual data entry tasks.
  
- Banking and Finance: OCR is employed in banking for reading checks, processing forms, and extracting information from financial documents. It facilitates faster processing of transactions and improves accuracy in tasks like check reading and automated form filling.
  
- Healthcare: In healthcare, OCR assists in digitizing medical records, prescriptions, and patient forms. It enables quick access to patient information, enhances data accuracy, and streamlines administrative tasks in hospitals and clinics.
  
- Retail and E-commerce: OCR is used in retail for tasks like inventory management, barcode scanning, and automatic price recognition. In e-commerce, it helps extract product information from images and catalogs, improving searchability and customer experience.
  
- Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR): OCR technology is utilized in ALPR systems for reading license plates on vehicles. It's employed in various applications such as traffic management, toll collection, parking enforcement, and security surveillance.
  
- Translation Services: OCR assists in language translation by converting printed text from one language into machine-readable text, which can then be processed by translation software. This enables the automatic translation of documents and websites.
  
- Accessibility: OCR helps individuals with visual impairments by converting printed text into accessible formats such as audio or Braille. It allows them to access information from printed materials like books, documents, and signs.
  
- Legal and Compliance: In legal and compliance domains, OCR is used for searching and analyzing large volumes of legal documents, contracts, and regulatory filings. It facilitates faster retrieval of relevant information and aids in compliance monitoring.
  
- Education: OCR is employed in educational institutions for tasks like grading exams, digitizing textbooks, and converting handwritten notes into editable text. It assists in creating accessible learning materials and automating administrative processes.

# 5.Project Execution Steps
<a name="execute"></a>

1.	Document Upload via Web Portal: 
Problem:  Many candidates submit their biodata and documents manually, which can lead to missing or incorrectly formatted files. Additionally, different formats (PDF, JPEG, PNG) can create challenges in handling and processing documents. 
Solution: The system provides an easy-to-use web portal where candidates can upload their biodata and documents in multiple formats. It ensures all required documents are uploaded correctly before submission, preventing errors at an early stage.

2.	Text Extraction Using OCR:  
Problem: Documents in image or scanned formats contain text that is not editable or searchable. Manual extraction is time-consuming and prone to errors. 
Solution:  The system uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to automatically extract text from scanned documents and images. This ensures that printed and handwritten documents can be processed efficiently without manual intervention.

3.	Language Translation: 
Problem: Candidates may submit documents in various regional languages, making it difficult for recruitment officers to verify their authenticity and correctness. 
Solution: A Translation API will convert text into a standardized language (English or Hindi). This ensures that all documents can be processed uniformly, regardless of the language in which they were originally submitted.

4. Text Processing and Data Matching 
Problem: Extracted text from documents may have errors, formatting issues, or incomplete information. Manually comparing the extracted data with the biodata is slow and inefficient. 
Solution: The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to clean and structure the extracted text, making it more readable. Then, it automatically compares the document data with the candidate’s biodata to ensure accuracy.

5. Instant Alerts for Errors 
Problem: Candidates are often unaware of errors in their documents until the later stages of recruitment, causing unnecessary delays. 
Solution: The system provides instant notifications if any mismatch or issue is detected. Candidates are alerted immediately, allowing them to correct and resubmit their documents without delay.

6. Secure Storage of Verified Data 
Problem: Manually stored documents can be lost, mismanaged, or accessed by unauthorized users, leading to security risks. 
Solution:  After verification, all documents and biodata are securely stored in a structured database with access control. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access the data, maintaining security and privacy.

# Future Scope
<a name="future"></a>
In the future, the system can be improved in several ways to make it more powerful and user-friendly. One important enhancement is the addition of biometric authentication, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning, which can provide an extra layer of security during the verification process. The platform could also include an AI-powered chatbot to guide users stepby-step, answer their queries instantly, and make the user experience more interactive. Support for voice-based input and regional language interaction would allow users to communicate with the system in their own language and style, making it more inclusive. Another improvement could be the integration of blockchain technology to store verified documents securely and ensure that they cannot be altered or tampered with. The system may also be linked with external databases such as university records or government ID services to allow automatic real-time cross-verification of submitted information. As more data is collected over time, machine learning models can be trained further to improve accuracy in reading and understanding various document types. A mobile application version of the platform could also be introduced to help candidates complete the entire process on their smartphones. These enhancements would make the system even more efficient, secure, accessible, and suitable for modern recruitment needs across different sectors.
